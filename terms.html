          <p class="hero-subhead">
            These terms govern the use of the Identity Anchor Protocol (IAP) Registry operated by Dirk Mischke (sole proprietor).
          </p>
        </div>

            <h2>1. Scope</h2>
            <p>
              These Terms apply to services provided via this website and related registry endpoints ("Registry").
              The Registry Operator is Dirk Mischke, operating as a sole proprietor (Einzelunternehmer).
            </p>

            <h2>2. Nature of the Service</h2>
            <p>
              The Registry issues and signs cryptographic certificates under the Identity Anchor Protocol (IAP) and
              provides interfaces for certificate verification and related metadata.
              A certificate attests that specific data was digitally signed by a specific key at a specific time.
            </p>

            <h3>2.1 Verification Boundaries</h3>
            <p>The Registry does <strong>not</strong> verify:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the behavior of autonomous agents,</li>
              <li>semantic correctness or truthfulness of submitted data,</li>
              <li>security or integrity of user systems, wallets, or runtime environments,</li>
              <li>economic outcomes, trading performance, or financial results.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Irreversibility of Certificates</h2>
            <p>
              Certificates are generated and digitally signed. Once issued, certificates are technically irreversible and cannot be altered.
              Unless explicitly stated otherwise, certificates are not revoked.
            </p>

            <h2>4. User Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>Users are solely responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>secure key management and access control,</li>
              <li>the correctness and legality of data submitted to the Registry,</li>
              <li>compliance with applicable laws and third-party terms (including payment providers).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>5. Availability</h2>
            <p>
              The Registry is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. No guarantee is given regarding uninterrupted availability,
              uptime, or permanent accessibility, unless explicitly agreed in writing.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Fees and Payments</h2>
            <p>
              Certain services may require payment (e.g., certificate issuance). Payment processing may be handled by third-party providers
              (e.g., Stripe). Fees are displayed on the website or within the issuance flow.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>
              Refunds may be considered prior to certificate issuance. Once a certificate has been issued, refunds are generally not possible
              due to the irreversible nature of cryptographic signing, except where mandatory law requires otherwise.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
              The Registry Operator is liable without limitation for intent and gross negligence.
            </p>
            <p>
              In cases of slight negligence, liability is limited to breaches of essential contractual obligations (Kardinalpflichten) and to
              foreseeable, typical damages.
            </p>
            <p>
              To the extent permitted by law, liability for indirect damages, consequential damages, loss of profits, or economic losses
              arising from the use of certificates is excluded.
            </p>

            <h2>9. No Warranty</h2>
            <p>
              No warranty is provided for fitness for a particular purpose. Certificates are cryptographic attestations and do not constitute
              guarantees of correctness, authenticity beyond signature validity, or suitability for any specific legal or commercial use case.
            </p>

            <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
            <p>
              These Terms are governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany.
            </p>
